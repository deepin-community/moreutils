# 'ifne' is compiled with correct hardening compile and link options (e.g.
# '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2'), but still, lintian thinks 'ifne' is not hardened
# enough.  As mentioned in #3673112, lintian sometimes has false positives,
# thus this override:
moreutils: hardening-no-fortify-functions [usr/bin/ifne]
